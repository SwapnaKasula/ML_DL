Classification algorithms divided by the number of classes to classify:

- Binary classification: only 2 classes
- Multiclass classification: more than 2 classes
- Multilabel classification (Multilabel-multiclass): multiple classes, but classes are binary. Ex: the presence of people in the image, Result — [0, 0, 1] or [1, 0, 1]
- Multioutput classification (Multioutput-multiclass): also known as multitask classification - multiple classes, but classes are not binary. Ex: predict the number of items, Result — [4, 0, 2] or [6, 0, 0].
